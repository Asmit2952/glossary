## What it is

Database-as-a-Service (DBaaS) is a database service managed by a cloud operator (public or private) that supports applications without requiring the application team to perform traditional database administration functions. With DBaaS, application developers need not need to be database experts, nor should they would need to hire multiple database administrators (DBA) to keep the database up to date.

## Problem it addresses 

Traditionally, in on-premises setups, organizations have to invest in additional storage and processing capacity on a regular basis to accommodate database expansion which can be expensive. 

Additionally, developers would also need to provision and configure databases with the help of IT infrastructure teams, slowing deployment speed of database-driven applications down. Loading and executing them also takes longer.

## How it helps

With DBaaS, it is possible to manage diverse sets of database from a single platform. Once a database is deployed, the cloud based service provider, is in charge of all back-end operations to keep it running smoothly, including configuration management, backups, patches, upgrades, service monitoring, and more, with a user-friendly interface to manage it all. This helps organizations develop enterprise-grade applications faster while minimizing database costs.
