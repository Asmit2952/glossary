## What it is

Database-as-a-Service (DBaaS) is a service managed by a cloud operator (public or private) that supports applications without requiring the application team to perform traditional database administration functions. With DBaaS, application developers should not need to be database experts, nor should they need to hire a database administrator (DBA) to keep the database up to date.

## Problem it addresses 

Traditionally in on-premise setups, organizations have to invest in additional storage and processing capacity on a regular basis to accommodate database expansion. Developers also need to provision and configure database with the help of IT infrastructure team. Deployment speed and database driven applications takes longer time to load and execute. This lack of features and scalibilty leads to increased costs and slow applications.

## How it helps

With DBaaS, it is possible to manage diverse sets of database from a single platform. Once a database is deployed, the cloud based service provider, is in charge of all backend operations to keep it running smoothly, including configuration management, backups, patches, upgrades, service monitoring, and more, with a user-friendly interface to manage it all. This helps organizations to develop enterprise level applications faster and keep if affordable at same time.
