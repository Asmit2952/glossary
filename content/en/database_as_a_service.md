## What it is

Database-as-a-Service (DBaaS) is a database service managed by a [cloud](https://glossary.cncf.io/cloud_computing/) operator (public or private) that supports applications without requiring the application team to perform traditional database administration functions. DBaaS allows app developers to leverage databases without being experts or hiring a database administrator (DBA) to keep the database up to date.

## Problem it addresses 

Traditionally, in on-premise setups, organizations regularly have to invest in additional storage and processing capacity to accommodate database expansion which can be expensive. Additionally, developers provision and configure databases with the help of IT infrastructure teams, slowing deployment speed of database-driven applications down. Loading and executing them also takes longer.

## How it helps

Once a database is deployed, the cloud-based service provider is in charge of all administration/administrative operations to keep it running smoothly. This includes configuration management, backups, patches, upgrades, service monitoring, and more, with a user-friendly interface to manage it all. DBaaS helps organizations develop enterprise-grade applications faster while minimizing database costs.
