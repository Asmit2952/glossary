## What it is
[Container](/container/) orchestration provides the ability to manage 
and automate the lifecycle of containerized applications in dynamic environments. 
This includes different aspects that are also pursued by [Cloud Native Technologies](/cloud-native-tech/) and [Cloud Native Apps](/cloud-native-apps/), 
such as: deployment, (auto)scaling, auto healing and monitoring.
It works like a conductor of an orchestra, who makes sure that every part of the orchestra does what it should.
managing [containerized](/containerization/) applications at scale 
(just like the OS on your laptop that manages your apps).

## Problem it addresses 
The rise of [Cloud Native Apps](/cloud-native-apps/) and [technologies](/cloud-native-tech/) 
as well as the fast-changing demands of modern businesses introduced a new set of problems. Managing [microservices](/microservices), security, and network-related things at scale, 
as well as [distributed systems](/distributed-systems) in general, 
are hard if not impossible to manage manually.   

## How it helps
Container orchestration provides a declarative method of automating much of the work, 
which makes the operational complexity manageable for software engineering teams.
This includes a variety of tasks, such as provisioning, deployment, scaling (both up and down), networking, load balancing, and other activities.
