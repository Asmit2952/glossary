## What it is
[Container](https://glossary.cncf.io/container/) orchestration automates container lifecycle management tasks such as provisioning, deployment, scaling, and networking in dynamic environments. It functions like a data center operating system (OS), managing [containerized](https://glossary.cncf.io/containerization/) applications that run across a [distributed system](https://glossary.cncf.io/distributed-systems/) (just like the OS on your laptop that manages your apps).

## Problem it addresses 
On behalf of the user, container orchestration organizes the compute, networking, and storage infrastructure. To ensure that applications are highly available and computing resources are used to their full potential, it does away with the requirement for direct manual orchestration in a cluster and automates the orchestration process.  

## How it helps
Container orchestration results in a more seamless customer experience by increasing productivity, resilience to failure, scalability, and flexibility. In addition to offering a platform for running, managing, and operating containers, it controls the container life cycle. For all container workloads and infrastructure, it offers a centralized management interface that also aids in logging and monitoring.
