## What it is
[Container](/container/) orchestration refers to managing and automating containerized applications' lifecycles in dynamic environments. 
It's executed through a [cloud native technology](/cloud-native-tech/) (in most cases, [Kubernetes[(/kubernetes)) that enables deployments, (auto)scaling, auto-healing, and monitoring. 
Orchestration is a metaphor. 
The orchestration tool conducts containers like a music conductor, ensuring every container (or musician) does what it should. 

## Problem it addresses 
The rise of [cloud native apps](/cloud-native-apps/) and technologies and the fast-changing demands of modern businesses introduced a new set of problems. 
Managing [microservices](/microservices), security, and network-related things at scale, as well as [distributed systems](/distributed-systems) in general, are hard if not impossible to manage manually.   

## How it helps
Container orchestration provides a declarative method of automating much of the work, which makes the operational complexity manageable for software engineering teams.
This includes a variety of tasks, such as provisioning, deployment, scaling (both up and down), networking, load balancing, and other activities.
